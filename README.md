Here is a `README.md` file for your real-time chat application deployed on AWS Lightsail with Next.js frontend and WebSocket backend:

# Real-Time Chat Application with Next.js and WebSocket on AWS Lightsail

## Overview
This project is a real-time chat application that leverages **Next.js** for the frontend and a **WebSocket** server for the backend. The application is containerized using **Docker** and deployed on **AWS Lightsail**.

### Features
- Real-time communication using WebSockets
- Dockerized frontend (Next.js) and backend (WebSocket) for portability and scalability
- Deployed on AWS Lightsail containers for cost-effective cloud hosting
- SSL configuration for secure WebSocket (`wss://`) communication

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Backend**: WebSocket server in Node.js
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS Lightsail
- **SSL Certificates**: AWS Lightsail's built-in SSL support

### Frontend
The frontend is built with **Next.js** and served via Docker. It handles the client-side of the chat interface and communicates with the WebSocket server hosted in the backend container.

### Backend
The backend is a **WebSocket** server built in **Node.js**, handling real-time bi-directional communication between chat clients.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Dockerize the Application

**Frontend Dockerfile:**

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app ./
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**Backend Dockerfile:**

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### 2. Build and Push Docker Images

```bash
# Build frontend
docker build -t <your-username>/realtime-chat-frontend:latest ./frontend

# Build backend
docker build -t <your-username>/realtime-chat-backend:latest ./backend

# Push images to Docker Hub (or another registry)
docker push <your-username>/realtime-chat-frontend:latest
docker push <your-username>/realtime-chat-backend:latest
```

### 3. Deploy to AWS Lightsail

1. **Create a Lightsail Container Service**:
   - Navigate to AWS Lightsail and create a container service.
   - Deploy both the frontend and backend containers from the images pushed to Docker Hub.

2. **Configure Ports**:
   - Frontend: Open port `3000`.
   - Backend: Open port `8080`.

3. **Set Up Networking**:
   - Use Lightsail’s built-in networking to assign static IP addresses or use the default Lightsail domain names for accessing the services.
   - Ensure WebSocket connections are enabled between frontend and backend containers.

4. **Connect the Frontend to the Backend**:
   - In the frontend, update the WebSocket connection to point to the backend's domain:
     ```js
     const socket = new WebSocket('wss://<backend-domain>:8080');
     ```

### 4. Optional: Custom Domain and SSL

- If you have a custom domain, you can set it up with AWS Lightsail's DNS.
- Configure SSL using Lightsail’s built-in certificate feature to secure WebSocket connections (`wss://`).

## Local Development

For local testing, you can use Docker Compose to run both services:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    networks:
      - chatapp-network

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    networks:
      - chatapp-network

networks:
  chatapp-network:
    driver: bridge
```

Run the following command to start the services locally:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Troubleshooting

- **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Ensure that both the frontend and backend are on the same network and can communicate via the correct WebSocket URLs.
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure that the backend allows requests from the frontend domain.
